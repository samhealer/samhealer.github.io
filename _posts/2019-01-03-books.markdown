### Bo Burnham - Egghead: Or, You Can't Survive on Ideas Alone
*3rd Jan-*

Bo Burnham is one of my favourite American comedians, and it's fair to say that he really came into his own with his 2013 special *what.*, which marked the beginning of his more serious, artistic output. *Egghead* is a collection of poems published that same year, which finds him flitting between his earlier, more juvenile sensibilities and his more introspective latter day work. It's a strong collection, even if a few poems rely too heavily on an abrupt swerve in the final line. The Flirt is an early example of Burnham grappling with the need to meet and match his audience's shifting expectations of him. Also worth noting are Chance Bone's illustrations, evocative of the way Dylan Moran uses a backdrop of thematically relevant doodles to amplify the ideas without being literal representations.
