### Nish Kumar: Very Clever Boy
*5th Jan*

A tight selection of routines predominantly from *Long Word* and *Actions*, the use of Phil Selway as a reference point always gets me. Part of Netflix's **Comedians Of The World**.


### Mae Martin: Dope
*5th Jan*

I've not had the chance to see Mae Martin in the wild yet, but definitely a voice to watch. The nerdy love of comedy is strong in this one. Part of Netflix's **Comedians Of The World**.

### Joel Dommett: This Is What I'm Capable Of
*5th Jan*

Joel Dommett is excitable at the best of times, but clearly recording this in Canada has added to that. A winningly charming set, even if it doesn't quite win over the locals. Part of Netflix's **Comedians Of The World**.
