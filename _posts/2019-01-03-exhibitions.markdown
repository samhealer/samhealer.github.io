### Musée des Arts et Métiers
*21st Jan*

Incredibly, this had more to say about the history of cinema than the last place. A historical science museum, split into seven sections with a clearly defined path through (as Hazel puts it, the sign of a good museum). It's slightly startling to see a DVD player as a display, but I suppose this is where we are now. A wide range of different subjects were on show, with the Measurements section surprisingly insightful. Definitely worth a visit.

### Cinematique Francais
*20th Jan*

This was my favourite French service experience on this trip. Having bought our tickets, we were sent up to a locked, empty, dark floor without ever being told that it didn't open for another hour. Once it did open, it was decidedly underwhelming. Lacking in breadth, depth, or any English text, the Cinematique Francais was hardly worth the 4 euro. That being said, most people were going to the Sergio Leone exhibition, which I presume must have been better. I probably won't be returning to find out for myself.

### The Louvre
*18th Jan*

I mean, it's the Louvre. I decided to get the obvious out of the way from the off, so went straight to the Mona Lisa. Strangely little to comment on that, to be honest - as iconic a painting as it is, it's hard to look at every other painting in the Louvre (of which there are, admittedly, many) and think "yep, the Mona Lisa is definitively better than all of these." I spent the rest of my time largely in the Italian and French wings, an experience which was both fascinating but also immeasurably improved once I started looking for paintings which looked like comedy nights. Only at the end did I realise that the Louvre was also the home of the Venus de Milo, so had a gander at that and was much more impressed than at the Mona Lisa.

Obviously the Louvre itself is a beautiful sight, and the glass pyramid is quite a sight in and of itself. From inside the museum, I took a photo of the pyramid from a window, and it took me longer than you'd think to notice that, hey, the Eiffel Tower was also in frame.
