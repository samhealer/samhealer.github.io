### Phil Ellis
*The Lazy Dog, 24th Jan*

I'd only seen Phil in his *Funz And Gamez* guise before, but the difference to his stand-up is hardly chalk and cheese. An absolute whirlwind of a show, with a lethal 5 minute distraction as Phil decided to investigate what was in the loft hatch without any way of getting up or more importantly down, and the closing "magic trick" had me properly slapping my thigh in uncontrollable laughter. Magnificent.

### Tom Glover
*OPPO, 23rd Jan*

Back to normal at OPPO. Tom Glover doing his first preview of his first Edinburgh show, and it went down a treat. The modern phonetic alphabet is a bit that can be so easily weaved throughout the show and fill any lulls as they come.

### Josh Widdicombe & Sara Barron
*OPPO, 17th Jan*

An absolutely rammed evening at OPPO, with Josh Widdicombe doing 45 of new stuff from pesto to weddings, and Sara doing her Edinburgh-nominated show again - I saw it in WIP form last year and it's even funnier now.

### Belly Laughs
*Squeezed, 15th Jan*

The return of Mark Olver's incredible series of charity gigs in Bristol's best restaurants. Squeezed is a fitting name for the night at this venue, with it being very much standing room only and the acts performing from behind the counter. Plenty of my favourites of the Bristol gang performing, plus a few rarer faces: Stu Goldsmith, Sally-Anne Hayward, Robin Allender, Charlie Baker, Becky Brunning, Iliza Frazer, with Rosie Jones headlining and Riordan DJ compering.

### Fern Brady
*OPPO, 9th Jan*

Trying out new material post-Belly Laughs gig, with a section on Arlene Foster and the DUP being a particular highlight.

### George Rigden
*OPPO, 2nd Jan*

An early preview of his 2019 Edinburgh show, George has refined his stage persona and mined the odd but true story of being friends with Uri Geller as a teenager.
