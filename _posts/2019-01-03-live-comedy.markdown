### Belly Laughs
*Squeezed, 15th Jan*

The return of Mark Olver's incredible series of charity gigs in Bristol's best restaurants. Squeezed is a fitting name for the night at this venue, with it being very much standing room only and the acts performing from behind the counter. Plenty of my favourites of the Bristol gang performing, plus a few rarer faces: Stu Goldsmith, Sally-Anne Hayward, Robin Allender, Charlie Baker, Becky Brunning, Iliza Frazer, with Rosie Jones headlining and Riordan DJ compering.

### Fern Brady
*OPPO, 9th Jan*

Trying out new material post-Belly Laughs gig, with a section on Arlene Foster and the DUP being a particular highlight.

### George Rigden
*OPPO, 2nd Jan*

An early preview of his 2019 Edinburgh show, George has refined his stage persona and mined the odd but true story of being friends with Uri Geller as a teenager.
