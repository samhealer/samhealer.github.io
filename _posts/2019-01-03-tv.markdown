### The Little Drummer Girl
*29th December-4th January*

I never actually got around to *The Night Manager*, the previous high-profile Le Carre BBC One adaptation (so look forward to that turning up on this page later this year), but if it's anywhere near as good as *The Littler Drummer Girl*, I'll be amazed. With Park Chan-wook at the helm for all six episodes, it both looks and feels in some sense romantic, matched with some wonderfully 70s panning camera work. There's an incredibly strong cast, with Michael Shannon menancingly brilliant as Kurtz and Florence Pugh ricocheting from naive to bullish confidence, and it's tightly written to maintain the right levels of suspense across the series. Proper "prestige drama" stuff but with genuine substance, paying off in the dying moments of the show.
