...as discovered during the process of moving flat for the first time in three and a half years:

* An never-used Google Glass
* Too many books
* No, seriously, too many books. Like, too many in the flat I had to myself, let alone the smaller flat I now share. 
* The ability to understand the Japanese word "tsundoku" - to have the habit of buying books at a faster rate than one reads them - and yet the inability to stop myself fulfilling this prophecy.
* My old flatmate Phoebe's blanket, so bequeathed to me 5 years ago now
* Pretty much every ticket I've ever bought from the Watershed in the last 7 years
* A number of signed setlists from artists including Philip Selway(!), Our Girl, and All We Are
* Old copies of the Metro with lyric fragments scribbled illegibly on them during long bus journeys on the 70 to and from work in the old days
* Insufficient bedding
* A real lack of visual space perception
* Thirteen brand new washing up sponges
* Five extension leads
* Two hot water bottles
* A mug from when I went to see The Muppets at the O2 that has never been used but was still carefully wrapped in newspaper to survive the journey to this flat, such that it may continue to not be used in peace, not pieces
* A microwave. It doesn't really occur to you that you actually *own* a microwave until you move into a flat that already has one and you're struck by the existential terror of what must become of your microwave. You've got to take it. Where do you put it? Can you sell it? Who would want it? Why?
* A collection of recipes clipped from magazines by my well-meaning but ultimately optimistic mother
* That being said, my own brownie recipe, perfected over much trial and error but gone unused for some time now
* A box of Cheerios in the cupboard from the time of the last Star Wars film. No, not Rise Of Skywalker. The previous one. Yeah.
* Barack Oblobblehead
* An innate desire or need to live with other people, even if most of that time is spent in a room alone, because as introverted as you can be and as great as it is to spent time by yourself, other people are great too. Even better if they have a dog.
* A bottle of Khazakstani vodka called Black Gold. It is neither of those two adjectives.
