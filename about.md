Hi, I'm Sam. I'm currently a software engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, based in Bristol, working on cloud storage. I graduated from Bristol with an MEng in Computer Science in 2016 and have been at HPE ever since.

I'm also a pop culture obsessive who loves all things music, film, TV, and books - I even write about these from time to time, for myself and for Epigram. I'm especially interested when technology and pop culture collide - like when I [wrote something to transform git repos into chiptune tracks](http://samhealer.com/projectpages/skylark/)</p>
