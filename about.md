Hi, I'm Sam. I recently graduated with an MEng in Computer Science from Bristol, and have been at Hewlett Packard Enterprise since September 2016. I'm a tech geek who enjoys trying out and finding uses for all kinds of technologies and platforms, from smartphones to supercomputers.

I'm also a pop culture obsessive who loves all things music, film, TV, and books - I even write about these from time to time, for myself and for Epigram. I'm especially interested when technology and pop culture collide.</p>
